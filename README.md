# E-Comet-Software-for-Shell-Eco-Marathon
DC Motor Controller software for the Shell Eco-Marathon 2024 by the team E-Comet Pierrard from the [School of Engineering of Pierrard-Virton](https://www.henallux.be/ecole-dingenieurs-departement-ingenieur-industriel-de-pierrard-virton).

The E-Comet team is composed of nine electromechanical engineering students. The team is composed of five subgroup :
- electronics and software
- aerodynamic and shell
- propulsion
- chassis
- steering

## Software

### The goal of the code
The code is there to control the DC motor thanks to a potentiometer. It will also collect all the data from the sensors and write them on micro SD card. Finally, it will show selected data on a OLED screen.

### Python Script
The Python script is used to process the data from the board to calculate the energy consumption, mean velocity or the battery voltage change.

## Controller PCB design
